# Library-Project
C++

This program is a library management system in C++ that uses file streams to parse through CSV files to take in information such as book titles, ISBNs, and checkout status. 
With this information output streams are used to display the library's statistics. 
The project uses vectors to store each category of information and allows for books to be removed through user input.
